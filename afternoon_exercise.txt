Why are we using Terminal?

This operating system comes under UNIX. The commands below will be applicable on any system, given access. This allows us to reduce steps along the way in SWE i.e Finding files; instead using the command line means we only need ONE process. Long story short- It makes things less complicated hence more efficient.

How do I open Terminal?

To Move into a directory you must already be in a folder one level up, then you enter: cd Documents —— Documents can be replaced by any folder I.e. Desktop

*tip* To move across directories not one level away, branch them together by using the / e.g Desktop/Documents/xyz

*tip* use tab button to autofill a directory you’ve already visited once you’ve began typing

How do I go back to my Home directory?

Cd

Cd -    brings you back down one folder e.g Back to documents

Why do we use Git?

Allows us to monitor and track file changes, as well as others who have access to the link.

How do I use Git?

First, we need to create a Git directory. But choose where you want to locate it first:

➜  afternoon_directory cd
➜  ~ pwd
/Users/ravi
➜  ~ ls
Desktop        Documents      Downloads      Library        Movies         Music          Pictures       Postman        Public         c6_coursenotes coursework
➜  ~ cd Desktop
➜  Desktop 

Above shows me leaving my directory, and checking where I am. Then I found the folder I want my work to be in.

Create the Git repository and enter it:
➜  Desktop mkdir git_intro
➜  Desktop cd git_intro
➜  git_intro 

Next we create a git repository within this directory(that is git_intro):

git init

➜  git_intro git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/ravi/Desktop/git_intro/.git/
➜  git_intro git:(main) 

How do we add and edit files on Git?

touch afternoon_exercise.txt


However, to actually upload this file to Git and have it tracked, we must enter the following code so that it is now “tracked”:

git add afternoon_exercise.txt 

Now this is done, however it is good to check our code for issues now rather than later, so we can edit difficulties one at a time and not go back and forth looking for the issues. To do this we use a code that allows us to check the status of our file:

git status

➜  git_intro git:(main) ✗ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   afternoon_exercise.txt

➜  git_intro git:(main) ✗ 

Things are updated and there are no issues, but for our file to be viewable on GithHub, we must commit our changes. This allows us to also keep a record of what’s been changed and when.
